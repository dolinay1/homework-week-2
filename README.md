I created the 3 html files, and then created a css stylesheet for specific changes outside the scope of bootstrap

After doing that I started with the index.html page which became my about-me page.

I added the navbar to the top and changed the color to a dark styling. (copied nav to the other pages)

I then moved the 3 links to the right of the page using justify-content-end.

For the index.html I made a card and centered it.

Within the card I put a placed-holder picture and and placeholder text.

For the footer on index.html I made 1 row with three columns and put the copyright
info in the center column. (copied to the other pages)

For the portfolio page i made 2 rows with 3 columns each and placed cards inside them.

Within the card I put a placed-holder picture and and placeholder text

For the contact page I made a simple contact form by creating 5 seperate form groups 
divided into email, name, phone number, message and a send button respectively
