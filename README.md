I created the 3 html files, and then added the html doc template.
After doing that I started with the index.html page which became my about me page.
I added the navbar to the top and changed the color to a dark styling. (copied nav to other pages)
I then moved the 3 links to the pages right.
For the index.html I made a card and centered it.
Within the card I put a placed-holder picture and and placeholder text.
For the footer on index.html I made 1 row with three columns and put the copyright info in the center column. (copied to other pages)

For the portfolio page i made 2 rows with 3 columns each and placed cards inside them.
Within the card I put a placed-holder picture and and placeholder text

For the contact page i made a simple contact form by creating 3 seperate form groups divided into email, name and messge
